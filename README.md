Sitemap &amp; wireframes presentation, a three-person team university assignment aiming to remake the University of Athens' website for class registrations and students' grading. After diagnosing the UI/UX design principles violations, we used Figma to: <br/>
• Recreate the whole interface, including user management, FAQ & error pages, for mobile optimization & modernization <br/>
• Add new features such as course filters to enhance user experience & simplify content management for professor and user personas <br/>
• Deliver a sitemap to explain website navigation 

<h6>Notes: Migrated from Google Drive to GitHub for visibility.</h6>
