Sitemap &amp; wireframes presentation, a three-person team university assignment aiming to remake the University of Athens' website for class registrations and students' grading. After diagnosing the UI/UX design principles violations, we used Figma to:
• Recreate the whole interface, including user management, FAQ & error pages, for mobile optimization & modernization
• Add new features such as course filters to enhance user experience & simplify content management for professor and user personas
• Deliver a sitemap to explain website navigation
